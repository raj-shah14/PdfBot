The curling competitions of the 2022 Winter Olympics were held at the Beijing National Aquatics Centre, one of the Olympic Green venues. Curling competitions were scheduled for every day of the games, from February 2 to February 20.[1] This was the eighth time that curling was part of the Olympic program.

In each of the men's, women's, and mixed doubles competitions, 10 nations competed. The mixed doubles competition was expanded for its second appearance in the Olympics.[2] A total of 120 quota spots (60 per sex) were distributed to the sport of curling, an increase of four from the 2018 Winter Olympics.[3] A total of 3 events were contested, one for men, one for women, and one mixed.[4]

Qualification
Main article: Curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification
Qualification to the Men's and Women's curling tournaments at the Winter Olympics was determined through two methods (in addition to the host nation). Nations qualified teams by placing in the top six at the 2021 World Curling Championships. Teams could also qualify through Olympic qualification events which were held in 2021. Six nations qualified via World Championship qualification placement, while three nations qualified through qualification events. In men's and women's play, a host will be selected for the Olympic Qualification Event (OQE). They would be joined by the teams which competed at the 2021 World Championships but did not qualify for the Olympics, and two qualifiers from the Pre-Olympic Qualification Event (Pre-OQE). The Pre-OQE was open to all member associations.[5]

For the mixed doubles competition in 2022, the tournament field was expanded from eight competitor nations to ten.[2] The top seven ranked teams at the 2021 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship qualified, along with two teams from the Olympic Qualification Event (OQE) – Mixed Doubles. This OQE was open to a nominated host and the fifteen nations with the highest qualification points not already qualified to the Olympics. As the host nation, China qualified teams automatically, thus making a total of ten teams per event in the curling tournaments.[6]

General Instructions
Purpose of Form
Form 1095-A is used to report certain information to the 
IRS about individuals who enroll in a qualified health plan 
through the Health Insurance Marketplace. Form 1095-A 
is also furnished to individuals to allow them to take the 
premium tax credit, to reconcile the credit on their returns 
with advance payments of the premium tax credit 
(advance credit payments), and to file an accurate tax 
return.
Who Must File
Health Insurance Marketplaces must file Form 1095-A to 
report information on all enrollments in qualified health 
plans in the individual market through the Marketplace. Do 
not file a Form 1095-A for a catastrophic health plan or a 
separate dental policy (called a stand-alone dental plan in 
these instructions).
When To File
File the annual report with the IRS and furnish the 
statements to individuals on or before January 31, 2023, 
for coverage in calendar year 2022.
The requirement to furnish a statement to individuals 
will be met if the Form 1095-A is properly addressed and 
mailed or furnished electronically (if the recipient has 
consented to electronic receipt) on or before the due date. 
If the regular due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or 
legal holiday, furnish the statement by the next business 
day. A business day is any day that isn't a Saturday, 
Sunday, or legal holiday.
How To File
Electronic filing. You must submit the information to the 
IRS electronically. Submit the information through the 
Department of Health and Human Services Data Services 
Hub.
Statements to Individuals
Furnishing required information to the individual. 
Marketplaces use Form 1095-A to furnish the required 
statement to recipients. A separate Form 1095-A must be 
furnished for each policy, and the information on the Form 
1095-A should relate only to that policy. If two or more tax 
filers are enrolled in one policy, each tax filer receives a 
statement reporting coverage of only the members of that 
tax filer's tax family (a tax family may include the tax filer, 
the tax filer’s spouse if the tax filer is filing a joint return 
with his or her spouse, and the tax filer’s dependents). 
See the instructions for line 4 for more information about 
who is a recipient. Don't furnish a Form 1095-A for a 
catastrophic health plan or a stand-alone dental plan. See 
the instructions for Part III, column A.
On Form 1095-A statements furnished to recipients, 
filers of Form 1095-A may truncate the social security 
number (SSN) of an individual receiving coverage by 
showing only the last four digits of the SSN and replacing 
the first five digits with asterisks (*) or Xs. Truncation isn't 
allowed on forms filed with the IRS.
Statements must be furnished to recipients on paper by 
mail, unless a recipient affirmatively consents to receive 
the statement in an electronic format. If mailed, the 
statement must be sent to the recipient’s last known 
permanent address, or if no permanent address is known, 
to the recipient’s temporary address.
Consent to furnish statement electronically. The 
requirement to obtain affirmative consent to furnish a 
statement electronically ensures that statements are sent 
electronically only to individuals who are able to access 
them. A recipient may provide his or her consent on paper 
or electronically, such as by email. If consent is provided 
on paper, the recipient must confirm the consent 
electronically. An electronic statement may be furnished 
by email or by informing the recipient how to access the 
statement on a Marketplace’s website (for example, in the 
recipient's Marketplace account).
Specific Instructions
Part I—Recipient Information
Line 1. Enter the Marketplace state name or 
abbreviation.
Line 2. Enter the number the Marketplace assigned to 
the policy. If the policy number is greater than 15 
characters, enter only the last 15 characters.
Line 3. Enter the name of the issuer of the policy.
Line 4. Enter the name of the recipient of the statement. 
This should be the person identified at enrollment as the 
tax filer (the person who is expected to file a tax return, to claim other family members as dependents, and who, if 
qualified, would take the premium tax credit for the year of 
coverage for his or her tax family). If the tax filer can't be 
identified from the information provided at enrollment (for 
example, because no financial assistance was 
requested), enter the name of the primary applicant for the 
coverage.
Line 5. Enter the social security number (SSN) for the 
recipient shown on line 4.
Line 6. Enter the recipient’s date of birth only if line 5 is 
blank.
Lines 7, 8, and 9. Enter information about the recipient’s 
spouse, if the recipient has one, if advance credit 
payments were made for the coverage. Enter this 
information even if the advance credit payments were not 
made for the spouse's coverage. Enter a date of birth only 
if line 8 is blank.
Line 10. Enter the date that coverage under the policy 
started. If the policy was in effect at the start of the year, 
enter 1/1/2022.
Line 11. Enter the date of termination if the policy was 
terminated during the year. If the policy was in effect at the 
end of the year, enter 12/31/2022.
Lines 12–15. Enter the recipient's address.
Part II—Covered Individuals
Enter on lines 16 through 20 and columns A through E 
information for each individual covered under the policy, 
including the recipient and the recipient's spouse, if 
covered. If advance credit payments were not made for 
any coverage under the policy and a tax family cannot be 
identified, enter in Part II information for all covered 
individuals. If advance credit payments were made for the 
coverage or a tax family can be identified, enter in Part II 
information only for covered individuals whom the tax filer 
certified at enrollment would be a part of the tax filer's tax 
family. Information about individuals enrolled in the same 
policy as the tax filer’s tax family who are not members of 
that tax family, including children, must be reported on a 
separate Form 1095-A.
For each line, enter a date of birth in column C only if 
column B is blank. Enter in column D the date the 
coverage started for the individual. Enter in column E the 
date of termination if the individual's coverage was 
terminated during the year. If the coverage was in effect at 
the end of the year, enter 12/31/2022.
Part III—Coverage Information
Enter information in Part III, lines 21 through 32, for each 
month of coverage. This information is determined on a 
monthly basis and may change during the year if there is a 
change in enrollment or other circumstances that affect 
eligibility for, or the amount of, the premium tax credit. 
Total the amounts on lines 21 through 32 and enter on 
line 33.
Column A. Enter the total monthly enrollment premiums 
for the policy in which the covered individuals enrolled. 
Include only the premiums allocable to essential health 
benefits. If a covered individual is enrolled in a 
stand-alone dental plan, include the portion of the 
premiums for the stand-alone dental plan that is allocable 
to pediatric dental coverage in the total monthly 
enrollment premiums. If more than one Form 1095-A is 
filed for coverage of the recipient’s family for the same 
months because, for example, a family member enrolled 
in a separate policy, include the portion of the premium for 
pediatric dental coverage in the amount in column A on 
only one Form 1095-A. If more than one tax filer is 
enrolled in a policy, report on each tax filer's Form 1095-A 
only those enrollment premiums allocated to that tax filer. 
If a policy is terminated by an issuer for nonpayment of 
premiums, enter -0- for a month in which the covered 
individuals have coverage but the premiums are not fully 
paid (generally, the first month of a grace period). If one or 
more covered individuals terminate coverage before the 
last day of a month, the amount reported in this column 
should not include any amount of the monthly enrollment 
premium that was refunded. If the issuer provided a 
premium credit for one or more months, the amount 
reported in this column should be the amount of the 
monthly enrollment premium as reduced by any premium 
credit.
Column B. Enter the premiums for the applicable second 
lowest cost silver plan (SLCSP) that was used as a 
benchmark to compute monthly advance credit payments. 
If advance payments were made, the applicable SLCSP 
for a month is the SLCSP that applies to individuals in Part 
II who were identified at enrollment as members of the tax 
filer's tax family (the tax filer, the tax filer's spouse if the tax 
filer is filing a joint return with his or her spouse, and any 
dependents of the tax filer) and who are enrolled in the 
coverage on the first day of the month and are not eligible 
for other health coverage for that month. However, if an 
individual enrolls in coverage and the enrollment is 
effective on the date of the individual's birth, adoption, 
placement in foster care, or on the effective date of a court 
order, the individual should be considered to have 
enrolled on the first day of the month for purposes of the 
applicable SLCSP premium reported in column B. If all 
covered individuals enroll after the first of the month, and 
no individual's coverage is effective on the date of the 
individual's birth, adoption, placement in foster care, or on 
the effective date of a court order, enter -0- in column B 
for that month. If more than one Form 1095-A is filed for 
coverage of a tax filer’s family for the same month (for 
example, because members of the family were split 
among several policies), enter the SLCSP premium that 
applies to all the family members who were enrolled in any 
policy on the first of the month and who were not eligible 
for other health coverage for that month. Enter this SLCSP 
premium in column B on each Form 1095-A.
In some cases, the information provided at enrollment 
may not indicate which covered individuals are members 
of the recipient's family and are not eligible for other health 
coverage. (Such information may not be provided, for 
example, because no financial assistance was 
requested.) If this is the case, and if the Marketplace has provided a tool for determining the applicable SLCSP 
premium for the year of coverage at the time of filing the 
tax return, leave column B blank. If the Marketplace has 
not provided a tool for determining the applicable SLCSP 
premium, enter the premiums for the SLCSP that would 
apply to all individuals identified in Part II as covered for 
the month.
If a policy is terminated by an issuer for nonpayment of 
premiums and advance credit payments are made, 
enter -0- for a month in which the covered individuals 
have coverage but the premiums are not paid (generally, 
the first month of a grace period). However, if an individual 
enrolled on the first day of a month terminates coverage 
before the last day of the month, the individual should be 
considered to have been enrolled for the entire month for 
purposes of the applicable SLCSP premium reported in 
column B.
Column C. Enter the amount of advance credit payments 
for the month. If more than one Form 1095-A is filed for 
coverage of a tax filer’s family for the same months, enter 
only the advance credit payment amount allocated to the 
policy reported on this Form 1095-A. If the tax filer’s family 
is also enrolled in a stand-alone dental plan, any advance 
credit payments allocated to the stand-alone dental plan 
should be added to the advance credit payments 
allocated to one of the policies reported on a Form 
1095-A.
Void Statements
If a Form 1095-A was sent for a policy that shouldn't be 
reported on a Form 1095-A, such as a stand-alone dental 
plan or a catastrophic health plan, send a duplicate of that 
Form 1095-A and check the VOID box at the top of the 
form. Provide this information to the IRS and to the 
recipient of the statement as soon as possible after 
discovering that the statement was sent in error.
Correction to Information Reported
Report corrected information on the Form 1095-A to the 
IRS and to the recipient as soon as possible after 
discovering that information reported is incorrect. Check 
the CORRECTED box on the top of the form.
